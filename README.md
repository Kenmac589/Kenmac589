## My Projects here on Github

- [Neovim and iTerm2 workflow](https://github.com/Kenmac589/alfred-iTerm-Neovim) not anything special in terms of programming but is nice for launching file with alfred.

## Some of the other work I've done

- [My Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/voices-of-stem/id1537339890) we interview STEM students at my university about their experiences in research, industry, etc.

## Apps that I love

A good chunk of the apps here can be installed as casks by [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install --cask <app name>`.

### FOSS MacOS apps I swear by

- [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) is a very powerful window manager with widow snapping similar to windows.

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is an excellent terminal emulator with many functions not present in apple terminal.
- [MonitorControl](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl#readme) can control the brightness of all screens you are using.  Great if using a monitor.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) excellent password manager to use across devices.
- [IINA](https://iina.io/) media player made for macos.
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) MacOS centric virtual machine app to run windows and linux distros.

### Just free MacOS apps I swear by

- [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) is a great utility for completely deleting apps on your computer.
- [CheastSheet](https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/) holding down the command âŒ˜ key will show you all the available keyboard shortcuts for an app.

## Important programs in my stack
