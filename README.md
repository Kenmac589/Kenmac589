## Important programs in my stack

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability.

- [ripgrep-all](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) is [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for most commonly used filetypes.  I use it in conjunction with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to search all document in my directory for key words when doing research.
