## My Projects here on Github

A good chunk of the apps here can be installed as casks by [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with `brew install --cask <app name>`.

### FOSS MacOS apps I swear by

- [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) is a very powerful window manager with widow snapping similar to windows.

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is an excellent terminal emulator with many functions not present in apple terminal.
- [MonitorControl](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControl#readme) can control the brightness of all screens you are using.  Great if using a monitor.

- [IINA](https://iina.io/) media player made for macos.
- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) MacOS centric virtual machine app to run windows and linux distros.

### Just free MacOS apps I swear by

- [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) is a great utility for completely deleting apps on your computer.
- [CheastSheet](https://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/) holding down the command ⌘ key will show you all the available keyboard shortcuts for an app.

## Important programs in my stack
